# Workflow CA

## Goal

## Brief

In this course assignment, the focus has been on improving the quality of the existing social-media-client application that fulfills the requirement for  these features:

- A front-end login form connected to an API JWT endpoint
- A front-end logout button connected to browser storage
- Front-end CRUD functionality for at least one object type
- A front-end profile page


## Project Configuration
The project incorporates the following configurations:

- Current e2e-test situation: tests pass and run fine in command line and in Cypress. May encounter that the e2e-test is running fine in command line and in Cypress app but not passing in workflow actions, if so it's due to issues with Cypress (ref. tutor C.O'Brien).


## Testing

### Unit Tests

*login.test.js*:
- Tests if the login function fetches and stores a token in browser storage
  
*logout.test.js*
- Tests if the logout function clears the token from browser storage


### End-to-End Tests

*login_logout.cy.js*
- Tests if the user can log in with a registered account
- Tests if the logged-in user can access the profile page
- Tests if the user can log out using the logout button

*invalid_login.cy.js*
- Tests if the user can not log in with invalid credentials
- Tests if the user is shown a message when an invalid login
