#Workflow CA

## Goal

The goal of this project has been to leverage the skills and knowledge gained from the Workflow course to enhance the quality of the existing Noroff API Social Media Client application by establishing the development workflows in action and implementing Unit testing and End-to-end testing.

## Brief

- A front-end login form connected to an API JWT endpoint
- A front-end logout button connected to browser storage
- Front-end CRUD functionality for at least one object type
- A front-end profile page

## E2E-Test Badge

- Current e2e-test situation: tests pass and run fine in command line and in Cypress. May encounter that the e2e-test is running fine in command line and in Cypress app but not passing in workflow actions, if so it's due to issues with Cypress (ref. tutor C.O'Brien).

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- The login function fetches and stores a token in browser storage.
- The logout function clears the token from browser storage.

### End-to-End Tests

- The user can log in and access their profile.
- The user cannot submit the login form with invalid credentials and is shown a message.
- The user can log out using the logout button.

## Test Commands

# Run unit tests with Jest
